# [MAC0323-Algorithms and Data Structures II](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=MAC0323)

Most of the assignments came from the [COS226](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring18/cos226/syllabus.php) course form Princeton. All assignments were made with Java using the [algs-4](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/) library by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

* [EP01](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring18/cos226/assignments/queues/index.html) : Implementing a double ended queue (deque) and a randomized queue.
* [EP02](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring18/cos226/assignments/percolation/index.html) : Checks if a n by n matrix [percolates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation).
* [EP03](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring18/cos226/assignments/8puzzle/index.html) : Solves a [N-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).
* [EP04](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring18/cos226/assignments/kdtree/index.html) : Finds the K-nearest-neighbors. Finds all points that fit a rectangle using a Kd-tree.
* [EP06](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring18/cos226/assignments/burrows/index.html) : File compression using the [Burrows–Wheeler transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows%E2%80%93Wheeler_transform).
* [EP07](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring18/cos226/assignments/seam/index.html) : Image resizing using the [Seam Carving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving) algorithm, only reducing the image size was required.
